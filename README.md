# Music-Webpage

This is a frontend project made by using Html,css,Javascript

sorry for the inconvenience of not uploading as a folder, anyway just make Images folder for all jpeg files and Audio for mp3 files

Each line is commented in javascript, So u can understand the need of each line. So just flow through the code

#AIM/GOAL
The goal is to create a basic webpage whivh will play some music when that instrument option is clicked 

The whole process is simple,
1st we will code the HTML part(Skeleton of the webpage)

2nd we will start styling(beautifying the skeleton) the HTML code using css

3rd and atlast we will use javascript to code the reponsive things

#Note
Just a few heads before running the final code.
1. The audio files are picked from internet, each audio file with different duration. So if you click multiple
2. instrument consectively, there is a chance of playing the sounds of both instruments simultaneously.
3. The best way to avoid, find and replace the audio files with same duration.

#The end
Run the html file and have fun
